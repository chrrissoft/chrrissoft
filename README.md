# Hi there 👋

Android developer with demonstrable experience of the Android Framework and Koltin. I am an apassionate about professional growth in the android world. I like to consolidate
my knowledge acquired in a practical way, developing an app where I try to
delve as much as possible into what you have learned. I have knowledge of app publishing in
Play Store, I have more than 15 apps on github and some on the Play Store.
