# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Android developer with demonstrable experience of the Android Framework and Koltin. I am a young
21 years old passionate about professional growth in the android world. I like to consolidate
my knowledge acquired in a practical way, developing an app where I try to
delve as much as possible into what you have learned. I have knowledge of app publishing in
Play Store, I have more than 15 apps on github and some on the Play Store. I am looking for a quality job
where to add value and acquire knowledge with a salary according to my experience.
