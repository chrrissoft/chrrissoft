# Hi there 👋

My name is Cristian, I am a 20-year-old boy, I am passionate about mobile application development,
I love learning every day and being better every day. I started in March of this year in Android development
and I currently have 3 applications in the Google Play Store. Each one has a purpose.

- Custom Keyboard. My first practical approach to Android 👩‍💻💚
- Notes and tasks. To learn basic CRUD operations 💾📗
- [Marvel app](https://github.com/chrrissoft/android_app_architecture). My favorite 😍, the one that has allowed me to learn in a 
practical way the guide recommended by Android Developers (and a little more 😄) for Android app development. 👷🏗️

These projects have allowed me to learn programming concepts, Kotlin and Android in a practical way. The most prominent are the following.

- Asynchronous, parallel and reactive programming with Flows and Coroutines.
- Build a scalable architecture for applications that get data from the internet and have offline support (with little business logic)
- Good practices, such as SOLID principles and Dependency Injection

In this time I have realized that I really like programming and I want to level up to become a complete senior.
I hope you can give me the opportunity to enter a work environment. Salary is not that important to me, I just want
to keep improving my skills (It doesn't mean I don't value myself as a developer). Thank you for reading.
