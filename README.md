# Hi there 👋

My name is Cristian, I am a 20-year-old boy, I am passionate about mobile application development,
I love learning every day and being better every day. I started in March of this year in Android development
and I currently have 3 applications in the Google Play Store. Each one has a purpose.

- [Custom Keyboard](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chrrissoft.tecladopersonalizado). My first practical approach to Android 👩‍💻💚
- [Notes and tasks](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chrrissoft.simpletodolist). To learn basic CRUD operations 💾📗
- [Marvel app](https://github.com/chrrissoft/android_app_architecture). To learn in a practical way the guide recommended by Android Developers for Android app development. 👷🏗️
- [English Words](https://github.com/chrrissoft/english_words). To learn to build an android app with clean architecture. I love it.

These projects have allowed me to learn programming concepts, Kotlin and Android in a practical way. The most prominent are the following.

- Asynchronous, parallel and reactive programming with Flows and Coroutines.
- Build a scalable architecture for applications that get data from the internet.
- Good practices, such as SOLID principles and Dependency Injection.
- Animations with Jetpack Compose

In this time I have realized that I really like programming and I want to level up to become a complete senior.
I hope you can give me the opportunity to enter a work environment. Salary is not that important to me, I just want
to keep improving my skills. Thank you for reading.
